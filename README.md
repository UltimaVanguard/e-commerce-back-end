# e-commerce-back-end

# Description

  I am creating an e-commerce back-end to allow a company to add, update, delete, and search for products. They'll be able to create categories to put the products into and tags for their products to help with searchability.

## Usage
  
  As this is currently just a back-end, you can use the schema to create the database in pg_admin. 
  
  Make sure to create a .env file and add DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PASSWORD values to connect to your database.

  Run 'npm i' to install dependencies.
  
  Run 'node seeds/index.js' on the command line to seed the database, then run 'node server.js' to start the server. 
  
  You can then add, update, delete and search categories, products, and tags using Insomnia.
